# SoSik
A mobile application about voice recognition and speech synthesis using API from Google Cloud Platform. This application is developed for people who have difficulty with hearing or speaking. 

The application includes two main functions. The application records user speaking with a microphone and transforms into text by using STT(Speech-to-Text) API. Another function is to change the text which the user typed in the text box into a voice via TTS(Text-to-Speech) API. Also, user can execute the app from foreground service by shaking the userâ€™s device twice to three times. It is based on Accelerometer sensor. It makes users easier to utilize this app. By developing this app, we show the effect of the android application for helping with communication for those who have auditory disorder.
